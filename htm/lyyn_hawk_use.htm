<h1>LYYN Hawk Operating Tips</h1>

<p>Early models of the Pro 4 control panel included a membrane keypad to control the LYYN functions.  VideoRay Cockpit software can now be used to control the LYYN functions.  See the LYYN documentation for information about using the keypad and the <a href="instrument_acc_lyyn.html"></a> section in the <a href="cockpit_.html">VideoRay Cockpit Guide</a> for more information about the software controls.</p>

<h2>Hardware Set Up</h2>

<p>The LYYN is factory installed in the control panel and does not require any hardware set up.</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<p>The LYYN keypad (physical or onscreen) includes an On/Off button to turn the LYYN on or off.  The amount of LYYNification can be controlled by pressing the increase or decrease buttons.  The size and location of the LYYNified area can be controlled by pressing the size button.</p>
